There are also outstanding bugs that I have been unable to fix, so new eyes on thus bugs would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Skills required\r\n\r\nGeneral coding skills and prior experience making desktop software for Windows. Portable-VirtualBox is written in AutoIt, but prior experience is probably now necessary if you are willing to spend some time learning it.
