There are also outstanding bugs that I have been unable to fix, so new eyes on thus bugs would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Skills required\r\n\r\nGeneral coding skills and prior experience making desktop software for Windows. Portable-VirtualBox is written in AutoIt, but prior experience is probably now necessary if you are willing to spend some time learning it. I did not know AutoIt when I did take over the project.\r\n\r\n### How to get in touch\r\n\r\nrunarb [at] gmail [dot] com\r\n\r\n### Meta Information (Please fill out)\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [FAQ section](https://seeking-maintainers.net/faq) and confirm that my project is eligible to be added to the list\r\n- [X] The title of this issue only displays the name of my project\r\n- [X] I have filled out the code snippet below\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# A link to the code repository or homepage of the project\r\nurl: \"https://www.vbox.me/\"\r\n\r\n# A short description of your project.
